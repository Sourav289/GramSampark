## ✅ Core JavaScript (ES6+)

Before jumping into backend work, make sure you're comfortable with modern JavaScript:

* ✅ **Variables & Data Types** (`let`, `const`, `var`)
* ✅ **Functions** (declaration, expressions, arrow functions)
* ✅ **Promises & Async/Await**
* ✅ **Callbacks**
* ✅ **Object & Array Destructuring**
* ✅ **Spread & Rest Operators**
* ✅ **Modules** (`import`/`export`, `require`)
* ✅ **Template Literals**
* ✅ **Classes & OOP Concepts**
* ✅ **Error Handling** (`try/catch`)
* ✅ **Higher Order Functions** (e.g. `map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
* ✅ **Closures & Scope**

---

## 🔧 Node.js Fundamentals

Node.js is the runtime for running JavaScript on the server.

* ✅ **What is Node.js and how it works**
* ✅ **Global objects** (`__dirname`, `__filename`, `process`)
* ✅ **CommonJS Modules** (`require`, `module.exports`)
* ✅ **Event Loop and Event Emitters**
* ✅ **File System (fs module)**
* ✅ **Streams & Buffers**
* ✅ **Process & Child Processes**
* ✅ **Error Handling in Node**
* ✅ **NPM & package.json**

---

## 🌐 HTTP & Server Creation

Understand how backend handles requests and responses.

* ✅ **HTTP Protocol basics** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* ✅ **Creating HTTP server using `http` module**
* ✅ **Understanding request and response objects**
* ✅ **Routing basics**

---

## 🚀 Express.js (Most common Node framework)

Simplifies backend development in Node.js.

* ✅ **Setting up Express server**
* ✅ **Routing (GET, POST, etc.)**
* ✅ **Middleware (custom, built-in, third-party)**
* ✅ **Request and Response objects**
* ✅ **Error handling middleware**
* ✅ **Serving static files**
* ✅ **Environment variables (`dotenv`)**

---

## 🛢️ Database Integration

Backends usually connect to a database:

### SQL (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL)

* ✅ **Basic SQL syntax**
* ✅ **Using ORMs like Sequelize or Knex**

### NoSQL (e.g. MongoDB)

* ✅ **Basics of MongoDB**
* ✅ **Using Mongoose (ODM for MongoDB)**

---

## 🛡️ Authentication & Authorization

Critical for any secure backend:

* ✅ **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
* ✅ **Session-based auth**
* ✅ **Password hashing (e.g., bcrypt)**
* ✅ **OAuth (optional but useful)**

---

## 🧰 Useful Tools & Libraries

* ✅ **Postman / Insomnia** (for API testing)
* ✅ **Nodemon** (auto-restarts your server during development)
* ✅ **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
* ✅ **Morgan** (for logging)
* ✅ **Helmet** (for security)
* ✅ **dotenv** (for environment variables)

---

## 🧱 Architecture & Practices

* ✅ **MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)**
* ✅ **Folder structure and modular code**
* ✅ **Middleware usage**
* ✅ **Error handling best practices**
* ✅ **Environment management (dev, prod, test)**
* ✅ **API documentation (e.g., Swagger)**

---

## 📦 Optional: Advanced Topics (Later)

* GraphQL
* WebSockets
* Background Jobs / Queues (e.g., Bull)
* Rate Limiting & Throttling
* API versioning
* Microservices
* Serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel)

---

## 📁 Project Ideas (To Practice)

* ✅ To-Do API
* ✅ Notes app backend
* ✅ Blog with login/signup and comments
* ✅ E-commerce backend (cart, checkout, orders)

---

If you're just starting, focus on:

1. Core JS + Node basics
2. Express.js
3. MongoDB + Mongoose
4. Building small REST APIs
