✅ Project 
Description:

"Empowering Citizens through Direct Grievance Reporting"

We are developing a mobile and web-based platform that allows the public to report local issues—such 
as sanitation problems, water supply issues, road maintenance needs, or public safety concerns—directly
to their respective panchayat or ward offices.

The goal is to create a transparent, efficient, and accountable communication bridge between citizens and
local government bodies. This system ensures faster resolution of local problems by enabling real-time tracking,
direct communication, and data-driven governance at the grassroots level.
